# Djukebox
The √êjukebox is a crypto currency jukebox meant to run in a HTML5-capable browser in kiosk mode. Perferably a raspberry pi.

# Prerequisites
* A webserver with PHP/MySQL (Can be self-contained on a raspi with LAMP or LEMP)
* A kiosk-mode HTML5 capable browser with MP3 support and an internet connection. (Chromium in my case)
* A way to create addresses for doge-, lite-, bitcoin. I personally use dogechain.info
* A monitor to display it on. It's designed for 1920x1080 but will work on any size with a bit of CSS fiddling.
* Some speakers hooked up to the PI.

# Install
Coming soon
